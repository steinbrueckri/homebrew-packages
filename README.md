# homebrew-packages

My personal homebrew tap (package repository for the homebrew package manager). <https://brew.sh>

## How to use

You only need to add this repo to your brew installation via the
`brew tap` command, like this `brew tap steinbrueckri/packages`.

## Test and CI

At the moment nothing :D
